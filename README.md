# ðŸš— Used Car Price Prediction - SIW Project

This project is part of the AI Bootcamp hosted by the AI Club at King Khalid University. Developed by **Team SIW**, it focuses on predicting the price of used cars based on mileage using linear regression.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

We built a simple machine learning model to analyze a real-world dataset of used cars. The goal was to predict car prices using mileage (`kmpl`) as the main feature. The project walks through data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, correlation analysis, model training, and prediction.

## ðŸ§  Key Features

- Cleaned and explored a real-world dataset (`Used Car Dataset.csv`)
- Visualized distributions and correlations using `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn`
- Trained a **Linear Regression** model with `Scikit-learn`
- Evaluated the model using RMSE and RÂ² score
- Performed predictions for sample mileage values

## ðŸ“Š Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
